## Motivation 

Oxygen was made as an alternative to Jira and other costly ticket system. It is made to be simpler, more powerfull and open to show that collaboration is also contributing to give everyone better tool to acheive more and make a better world.


## Not agile ?

Oxygen uses and make the most of agile methodologie, but you do not have to be an expert to use it. You don't even have to know anything about agile to start managing your projects.

## Disponibility

Since the code is still in early developpement, I'm waiting a little to make it more stable to share it. The beta version will be the first to be released open and should be available in Q2-Q3 2022. Since then you are most welcome to try the alpha version and to follow this repository.
